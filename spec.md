# Specifications for the Rails Projects

Specs:
- [x] Use Ruby on Rails framework
- [x] must include at least one has_many, at least one belongs_to, and at least two has_many :through relationships

User has_many posts
Post belongs_to a user
User has_many commented_post through post_comments
Post has_many users_who_commented through post_comments

- [x] must include a many-to-many relationship implemented with has_many :through associations. The join table must include a user-submittable attribute — that is to say, some attribute other than its foreign keys that can be submitted by the app's user

User has_many :commented_posts, through: :post_comments, source: :post
Post has_many :users_who_commented, through: :post_comments, source: :user
Post_comment belongs_to :user
Post_comment belongs_to :post
Post_comments user-submittable attributes: username, body


- [x] models must include reasonable validations for the simple attributes to avoid invalid data.

- [x] must include at least one class level ActiveRecord scope method

scope :famous_users, -> {where("view > ?", 50)}

def self.in_age(age)
    where(:age => age)
end

can be used as User.famous_users which will then return users whose "view" attribute is greater than 50.
can be further chained with class method by User.famous_users.in_age(30) will return famous_users whose "age" attribute is 30.
