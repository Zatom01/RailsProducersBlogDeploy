# Specifications for the Rails Projects

Specs:
- [x] Use Ruby on Rails framework
- [x] must include at least one has_many, at least one belongs_to, and at least two has_many :through relationships

User has_many posts
Post belongs_to a user
User has_many commented_post through post_comments
Post has_many users_who_commented through post_comments

- [x] must include a many-to-many relationship implemented with has_many :through associations. The join table must include a user-submittable attribute â€” that is to say, some attribute other than its foreign keys that can be submitted by the app's user

User has_many :commented_posts, through: :post_comments, source: :post
Post has_many :users_who_commented, through: :post_comments, source: :user
Post_comment belongs_to :user
Post_comment belongs_to :post

scope :famous_users, -> {where("view > ?", 50)}
